# About

## This is one of the first projects I accomplished during the MIT Bootcamp I took part in. The program passes through an array of pacman images, while moving the current object (one of the 4 images) forward and bacground within a boundary. 

# Operating the Program
## Simply copy the link into the browser, and the program will operate.

# Roadmap For Future Improvements
## I'd like to, in classic PacMan fashion, illustrate the pacman being chased by a ghost.
