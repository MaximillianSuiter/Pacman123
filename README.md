# About

## This is one of the first projects I accomplished during the MIT Bootcamp I took part in. The program creates an additional pacman at the click of a button, and moves the createx pacmen randomly within the bounds of the window upon another click. 


# Operating the Program
## Download the files present, and drag and drop the index.html file into the search bar of the browser. Click "Add Pacman" to add a pacman, click "Start Game" to set created pacmen in motion 

# Roadmap For Future Improvements
## I'd like to, in classic PacMan fashion, illustrate the pacman being chased by a ghost.
